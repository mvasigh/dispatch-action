> Create repository dispatch events to trigger a Github workflow from within another workflow

## üöÄ Usage

To use this action, you need to create a Github workflow file in your repository under the `.github/workflows` directory. You also must create a Github [personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line), which should be stored as a secret in your Github repository.

Here is an example of a Github workflow file that uses this action to trigger a `sample-push` event in another repository:

```yaml
name: Alert parent repository on push
on: push

jobs:
  build:
    name: Dispatch to `other-repo`
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Emit repository_dispatch
        uses: mvasigh/dispatch-action@master
        with:
          # You should create a personal access token and store it in your repository
          token: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
          repo: other-repo
          owner: mvasigh
          event_type: sample_push
```

The emitted event can be consumed in another Github workflow, either within the same repository or another one. Here's an example:

```yaml
name: Print on external push

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on repository_dispatch and filters by type of event (i.e. `event_type`)
on:
  repository_dispatch:
    types: [sample_push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo Hello, world!
      - name: Run a multi-line script
        run: |
          echo Add other custom actions to build,
          echo test, and deploy your project.
```

By default, this action will hydrate the `client_payload` of the repository dispatch event with the original event payload under the `event` key. You can also send any additional data by supplying the `message` input option, which will also be available under the `message` key of the `client_payload` object. This can be used in other workflows by accessing `${{ github.event.client_payload.message }}` in any workflow triggered by this action.

Here is an example:

## üìù Options

This action accepts the following options:

`token` **(required)** - a Github [personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)

`event_type` **(required)** - a name for the type of event that you are emitting

`repo` - name of the repository to dispatch event to (same repository by default)

`owner` - Github org/name of the repository's owner (event sender's name by default)

`message` - optional data to send along with the event (must be a JSON string)
